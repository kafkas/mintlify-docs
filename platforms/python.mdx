Typesync lets you generate Python/Pydantic types for the Firestore models defined in your Typesync schema. First, Typesync "flattens" your schema, creating new aliases for inline types defined within. It then generates the classes, enums, aliases, etc. including encoders and decoders.

## Platforms

- `firebase-admin@6`: For Python projects that rely on the [Firebase Admin Python SDK (v6)](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python).
