Typesync lets you generate Swift types for the Firestore models defined in your Typesync schema. First, Typesync "flattens" your schema, creating new aliases for inline types defined within. It then generates the primary and auxiliary structs, enums, aliases, etc. including encoders and decoders.

## Platforms

- `swift:firebase:10`: For Swift projects that rely on the [Firebase Apple SDK (v10)](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk).
