## Step 1: Install Typesync CLI

First, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ installed. Then, install the Typesync CLI using npm:

```bash
npm install -g typesync-cli
```

## Step 2: Create your schema

Create a directory within your project to store your Typesync definition files. A common practice is to name this directory `definition`.

```bash
mkdir definition
cd definition
```

Next, create a YAML file named `models.yml` in the `definition` directory. This file will contain the schema definitions for your Firestore documents. Here's a sample schema:

```yaml models.yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.typesync.org/v0.6.json

UserRole:
  model: alias
  docs: Represents a user's role within a project.
  type:
    type: enum
    members:
      - label: Owner
        value: owner
      - label: Admin
        value: admin
      - label: Member
        value: member

User:
  model: document
  docs: Represents a user that belongs to a project.
  type:
    type: object
    fields:
      username:
        type: string
        docs: A string that uniquely identifies the user within a project.
      role:
        type: UserRole
      website_url:
        type: string
        optional: true
      created_at:
        type: timestamp
```

## Step 3: Generate type definitions

You can now generate the types for the relevant platform. For example, if your project is a Node.js backend that uses Firebase Admin SDK (version 11), run the following command:

```bash
typesync generate-ts --definition 'definition/**/*.yml' --platform firebase-admin@11 --outFile models.ts
```

This command tells Typesync to:

- take all `.yml` files in the `definition` directory as the schema definition
- generate TypeScript interfaces for use with the Firebase Admin SDK (version 11)
- write the generated types to the `models.ts` file in the current directory

Here's what the generated TypeScript file might look like:

```ts models.ts
import type { firestore } from "firebase-admin";

export type Username = string;

/** Represents a user's role within a project. */
export type UserRole = "owner" | "admin" | "member";

/** Represents a user that belongs to a project. */
export interface User {
  /** A string that uniquely identifies the user within a project. */
  username: Username;
  role: UserRole;
  website_url?: string;
  created_at: firestore.Timestamp;
}
```

## Step 4: Integrate into your development workflow

You should regenerate your types anytime the schema changes. To streamline development, consider integrating the Typesync generation command into your build process or CI/CD pipeline.

### Version Control

Decide if you want to version control the generated files. It can be beneficial for ensuring consistency across environments but may require additional maintenance.

### Multiple Files

If your project grows, you might want to split your schema into multiple YAML/JSON files. Typesync will automatically handle all files matching the pattern that you provide to it through the `--definition` option.
