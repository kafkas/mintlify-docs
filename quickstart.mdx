Use `typesync init` to create a Typesync definition and start generating types.

```yaml models.yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.typesync.org/v0.1.json

User:
  model: document
  docs: Represents a user that belongs to a project.
  type:
    type: object
    fields:
      username:
        type: string
        docs: A string that uniquely identifies the user within a project.
      role:
        type:
          type: enum
          items:
            - label: Owner
              value: owner
            - label: Admin
              value: admin
      created_at:
        type: timestamp
```
