You can install the Typesync CLI either globally or on a per-project basis (locally) depending on your use case. Both options are perfectly valid but, when possible, it's a good idea to install it locally to explicitly tie your project to a specific Typesync CLI version.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite:** The Typesync CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18
  or above to be installed on your machine.

```bash Global
npm i -g typesync-cli
```

```bash Local (Node.js projects)
npm i typesync-cli
```
