You can install TypeSync either globally or on a per-project basis (locally) depending on your use case. Both options are
perfectly fine but, when possible, it's a good idea to install it locally to explicitly tie a project to a specific
TypeSync CLI version.


<Info>**Prerequisite:** TypeSync requires Node.js 18 or above to be installed on your machine.</Info>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Global
npm i -g typesync-cli
```

```bash Local (Node.js)
npm i typesync-cli
```

</CodeGroup>
