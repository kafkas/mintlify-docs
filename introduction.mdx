TypeSync is a schema management tool for Firestore. With TypeSync, you define the schema for your Firestore models
and auto-generate type definitions for TypeScript, Swift, Python and other languages using the CLI tool. TypeSync
also lets you generate other useful things like Firestore Rules and Cloud Functions boilerplate.

The TypeSync schema is the single source of truth for your Firestore architecture.
