TypeSync is a schema management tool for Firestore. With TypeSync, you define the schema for your Firestore models
and auto-generate type definitions for TypeScript, Swift, Python and other languages using the CLI tool. TypeSync
also lets you generate other useful things like Firestore Rules and Cloud Functions boilerplate.

The TypeSync schema is the single source of truth for your Firestore architecture.

## TypeSync in 30 seconds

## Design Goals

TypeSync is designed to adhere to the following principles.

### 1. Predictable (dumb)

No "gotchas", no secret configurations, no special directories, no implicit assumptions. TypeSync never tries to outsmart
you. If you give it bad parameters it will _not_ try to make the most the situation. It will likely either error or produce
a bad output. This is because we believe it's crucial for TypeSync to not have any unexpected behaviour even if that behaviour
may be considered useful for a subset of developers. We believe developer tools that are unpredictable often cause frustration
and confusion and overall a bad developer experience. We want TypeSync to do exactly and only what it promises to do. Nothing
more, nothing less.

### 2. Ejectable

There's no "lock-in". TypeSync is not a library that tightly attaches itself to your code. You can eject from
TypeSync at any time by simply copy-pasting the generated output into your source code without having to refactor your code.
That's why it's extremely easy to adopt _and_ abandon!

### 3. Configurable

Everything that can be reasonably expected to be configurable is made explicitly configurable.
