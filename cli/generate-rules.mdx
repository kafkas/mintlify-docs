Generates type validator functions for Firestore Security Rules (version 2) and injects them into the specified file.

Since Security Rules are centralized in a single file (typically `firestore.rules`), and developers often implement custom rules alongside type validations, Typesync inserts only the necessary validator functions, without overriding your custom rules. You can specify where these validators are added within the file using the `--startMarker` and `--endMarker` options. For a detailed guide, see the full [example](#example) below.

<Info>
  Note that these validators must adhere to the intrinsic limitations of
  Security Rules. For example, while it's feasible to verify if `x` is a list
  with the `x is list` predicate, determining whether it's a list of strings is
  not possible since loop constructs are not available in Security Rules.
  Typesync will provide the most stringent validation possible within these
  constraints.

## Usage

```bash
typesync generate-rules --definition <filePathOrPattern> --outFile <filePath> --startMarker <startMarker> --endMarker <endMarker> --validatorNamePattern <validatorNamePattern> --validatorParamName <validatorParamName> --indentation <indentation> --debug <debug>
```

## Options

<DefinitionOption />
<OutFileOption />

<ParamField type="string" path="startMarker" default="typesync-start">
  A marker that indicates the line after which the generated code should be
  inserted. Make sure to use a string that is unique within the file. The line
  containing the marker must be commented i.e. the marker needs to appear after
  the `//` (see [example](#example)).

  </ParamField>

<ParamField type="string" path="endMarker" default="typesync-end">
  A marker that indicates the line before which the generated code should be
  inserted. Make sure to use a string that is unique within the file. The line
  containing the marker must be commented i.e. the marker needs to appear after
  the `//` (see [example](#example)).
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  type="string"
  path="validatorNamePattern"
  default="isValid{modelName}"
>
  The pattern that specifies how the generated type validators are named. The pattern must be a string that contains the `"{modelName}"` substring (this is a literal value).
  
  Example values:

    - `"isValid{modelName}"` -> produces validators like `isValidUser`, `isValidProject`, `isValidAccount` etc.
    - `"is{modelName}"` -> produces validators like `isUser`, `isProject`, `isAccount` etc.

  </ParamField>

<ParamField type="string" path="validatorParamName" default="data">
  The name of the parameter taken by each type validator.
</ParamField>

<DebugOption />

## Example

Suppose you have a schema definition file named `models.yml` and a Security Rules file named `firestore.rules`.

<CodeGroup>
  <ExampleDefinition />
  <ExampleGenerationRulesBefore />
</CodeGroup>

To generate type validators for the defined models and inject them between the `typesync-start` and `typesync-end` markers in the `firestore.rules` file, you can run the following command:

```bash
typesync generate-rules --definition definition.yml --outFile firestore.rules --startMarker typesync-start --endMarker typesync-end
```

Typesync will insert the `isValidUserRole()` and `isValidUser()` validators into the file. You can then use these validators as needed in your custom rules.
