The Typesync schema for a project is defined in a collection of YAML files. A definition requires a single
_root_ file and any number of model definition files. The root file includes the specification version and the location of the other YAML files comprising the definition.

## Root file

<ParamField path="spec-version" type="string">
  The Typesync specification version for this definition. Using a recent spec
  version will ensure that you have access to all the latest features. You can
  view the list of available spec versions [here](https://typesync.org).
  {/* TODO: Add link */}
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="models" type="string | string[]">
  The path or paths to the files containing your model definitions. You can
  specify the location of your definition files with
  [Glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) patterns and/or exact paths.
</ParamField>

### Example

```yaml root.yml
spec-version: 0.1

# All the .yml files in the current directory and the nested
# directories should be included in the Typesync definition.
models: "**/*.yml"
```

## Model definitions

Your definition can contain as many model definition files as you need and you can organize them any way you want. There are two types of models that you can define in a model definition file: document models and alias models.

### Document models

A document model represents the shape of a document in a particular Firestore collection.

There are two Typesync types that can represent the shape of a document model: `object` and `map`. Use `object` when you know the exact fields that the document should contain (this is most often the case). Use `map` when the document is used as a mapping from arbitrary strings to other types. TODO

<ParamField path="model" type='"document"' required>
  A literal field that specifies that this is a `document` model.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="docs" type="string">
  Optional documentation explaining the model in more detail. Typesync will add
  this to the doc comments for the generated models.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="hash" required>
  The type representing the shape of the document. A document can be represented
  by either an `object` or a `map`. TODO
</ParamField>

#### Example

```yaml user.yml
User:
  model: document
  docs: Represents a user that belongs to a project.
  type:
    type: object
    fields:
      name:
        type: string
        docs: The full name of the user.
      created_at:
        type: timestamp
```

### Alias models

An alias model is used for convenience purposes to define reusable type aliases. You can use the same alias model in multiple document models. You can also use alias models when composing other aliases.

<ParamField path="model" type='"alias"' required>
  A literal field that specifies that this is an `alias` model.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="docs" type="string">
  Optional documentation explaining the model in more detail. Typesync will add
  this to the doc comments for the generated models.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="string | hash" required>
  The type representing the shape of the document. TODO
</ParamField>

#### Example

```yaml user.yml
UserRole:
  model: alias
  docs: Represents a user's role within a project.
  type:
    type: enum
    items:
      - label: Owner
        value: owner
      - label: Admin
        value: admin
      - label: Member
        value: member
```
