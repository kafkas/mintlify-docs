The Typesync schema for a project is defined in a collection of YAML files. Your definition can contain as many model definition files as you need and you can organize them any way you want. There are two types of models that you can define in a model definition file: document models and alias models.

## Document models

A document model represents the shape of a document in a particular Firestore collection.

<ParamField path="model" type='"document"' required>
  A literal field that specifies that this is a `document` model.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="docs" type="string">
  Optional documentation explaining the model in more detail. Typesync will add
  this to the doc comments for the generated models.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="hash" required>
  The type representing the shape of the document. A document can be represented
  only by an `object` type.
</ParamField>

### Example

```yaml user.yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.typesync.org/v0.1.json

User:
  model: document
  docs: Represents a user that belongs to a project.
  type:
    type: object
    fields:
      name:
        type: string
        docs: The full name of the user.
      created_at:
        type: timestamp
```

## Alias models

An alias model is used for convenience purposes to define reusable type aliases. You can use the same alias model in multiple document models. You can also use alias models when composing other aliases.

<ParamField path="model" type='"alias"' required>
  A literal field that specifies that this is an `alias` model.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="docs" type="string">
  Optional documentation explaining the model in more detail. Typesync will add
  this to the doc comments for the generated models.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="string | hash" required>
  The type representing the shape of the document. TODO
</ParamField>

### Example

```yaml user.yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.typesync.org/v0.1.json

UserRole:
  model: alias
  docs: Represents a user's role within a project.
  type:
    type: enum
    items:
      - label: Owner
        value: owner
      - label: Admin
        value: admin
      - label: Member
        value: member
```

## Autcomplete/Intellisense

When writing your definition, always include the following line at the top of each definition file.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.typesync.org/v0.1.json
```

This indicates to your IDE that the file is not just any YAML file but a part of a Typesync definition. This will allow your IDE to provide Intellisense/autocomplete for definition fields.

<Info>
  For the time being, you need manually synchronize the schema version in this
  line with the Typesync version you're using. For example, if you're using
  Typesync version 0.5.4, you need to make sure that the version in the above
  schema URL is `v0.5` (patch version excluded).
